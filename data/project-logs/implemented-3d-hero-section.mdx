Today I made significant progress on the portfolio's hero section. After experimenting with several concepts, I settled on a 3D animated geometric shape that responds to mouse movements.

## What I Did Today

- Set up React Three Fiber and imported necessary dependencies
- Created a geometric shape using Three.js geometry
- Implemented mouse interaction for rotation and movement
- Added subtle color shifts based on mouse position
- Optimized performance to maintain 60fps on most devices

## Code Snippet

Here's the core component that handles the 3D animation:

```jsx
const HeroScene = () => {
  const mesh = useRef()
  const [hovered, setHovered] = useState(false)
  
  useFrame((state, delta) => {
    mesh.current.rotation.x += delta * 0.1
    mesh.current.rotation.y += delta * 0.15
    
    // Smooth lerp to target scale on hover
    mesh.current.scale.x = THREE.MathUtils.lerp(
      mesh.current.scale.x,
      hovered ? 1.2 : 1,
      0.1
    )
    mesh.current.scale.y = THREE.MathUtils.lerp(
      mesh.current.scale.y,
      hovered ? 1.2 : 1,
      0.1
    )
    mesh.current.scale.z = THREE.MathUtils.lerp(
      mesh.current.scale.z,
      hovered ? 1.2 : 1,
      0.1
    )
  })
  
  return (
    <mesh
      ref={mesh}
      onPointerOver={() => setHovered(true)}
      onPointerOut={() => setHovered(false)}
    >
      <dodecahedronGeometry args={[1.5, 0]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial 
        color={hovered ? "#6366f1" : "#8b5cf6"} 
        wireframe={true}
      />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

## Challenges

The main challenge was getting the performance right. Initially, I was seeing frame drops on mobile devices. I addressed this by:

1. Simplifying the geometry (reducing polygon count)
2. Using wireframe rendering instead of full shading
3. Implementing a performance detection system that reduces effects on less capable devices

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I plan to:

- Add a subtle particle effect in the background
- Implement scroll-based animations for the hero section
- Connect the 3D element to the rest of the page content
- Refine the color scheme and transitions

Overall, I'm really happy with how the hero section is coming together. The interactive 3D element adds visual interest without being distracting or hurting performance.
