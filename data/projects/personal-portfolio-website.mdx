## Project Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, designed and developed to showcase my work as a frontend developer. The site features a modern, responsive design with smooth animations and interactive 3D elements.

### Features

- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices from mobile to desktop
- **Dark/Light Mode**: User-togglable theme preference
- **3D Elements**: Interactive 3D elements using React Three Fiber
- **Project Showcase**: Detailed case studies for major projects
- **Blog Section**: Technical articles and tutorials
- **Contact Form**: Easy way for potential clients to reach out

## Development Process

### Planning and Design

Before writing any code, I spent time planning the site structure and designing mockups in Figma. I wanted to create something that stood out while still being clean and professional.

### Technology Choices

I chose Next.js for its excellent performance, SEO capabilities, and built-in routing. Tailwind CSS was perfect for rapidly building a custom design system, and React Three Fiber allowed me to add engaging 3D elements.

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the biggest challenges was optimizing the 3D elements for performance across different devices. I implemented progressive enhancement techniques to ensure the site remains fast and accessible even on lower-powered devices.

## Results

The portfolio has been well-received by the community and has helped me secure several freelance opportunities. The project demonstrates my skills in modern frontend development and UI/UX design.

## What I Learned

This project significantly improved my skills with:

- Building performant Next.js applications
- Creating responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS
- Implementing 3D web graphics with Three.js
- Animation techniques with Framer Motion
- Deploying and optimizing for production

I'm particularly proud of the performance optimizations I implemented, resulting in a 95+ Lighthouse score across all categories.
